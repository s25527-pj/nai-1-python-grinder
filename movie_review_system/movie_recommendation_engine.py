"""
Movie Recommendation System
Authors: Maciej Uzarski, Maksymilian Mr√≥wka

Environment Setup:
1. Navigate to the directory
    - cd path/to/movie_review_system

2. Install necessary dependencies:
    - pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the code:
   - Execute the script with `python movie_recommendation_engine.py`

Description:
- The script performs clustering of movies based on three features: rating (Rating), genre (Genre), and subgenre (Subgenre).
- Clusters are created using the KMeans algorithm, and movie recommendations are provided based on clusters with similar movies that the user has rated highly.
- Example: Cluster 1 mainly consists of comedies and sci-fi movies with some other subgenres, and the average rating is around 7.60.
  If user asks for recommendations, movies that he has rated highly from Cluster 1 will be recommended, and other movies from Cluster 1 that he hasn't seen yet will be suggested.
