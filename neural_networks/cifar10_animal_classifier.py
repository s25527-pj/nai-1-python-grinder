Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Author: Maksymilian Mr√≥wka, Maciej Uzarski

Environment Setup:
1. Navigate to the directory containing the script:
    - cd path/to/neural_networks
2. Install required dependencies:
    - pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the script:
    - Execute the script with `python cifar10_animal_classifier.py`

Description:
- This script implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 categories.
- The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
- The images are normalized by scaling pixel values to the range [0, 1] to improve training stability.
- The CNN architecture includes:
  1. Convolutional layer: 32 filters of size 3x3 with ReLU activation.
  2. MaxPooling layer: Down-samples feature maps using 2x2 pooling.
  3. Flatten layer: Converts 2D feature maps into 1D vectors for the fully connected layers.
  4. Fully connected layer: 128 neurons with ReLU activation.
  5. Output layer: 10 neurons with softmax activation for multi-class classification.
- The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function, using accuracy as the evaluation metric.
- Training is conducted over 10 epochs with validation on the test dataset.
- The script evaluates the model's performance on the test dataset, displaying accuracy and loss metrics.
